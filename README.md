Ambient Soundscape Generator
version 1.0


WHAT IS IT?
Imagine an app that creates an entire soundscape around your favourite jingle, sound or piece of music.
The Ambient Soundscape Generator quietly works behind the scenes to bring you real-time ambient soundscapes, based on the audio file you provide it with.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Turn the sound on by clicking the speaker button on the top-right corner
     of the app. 
2. Drag and drop your audio file. (.mp3, .wav, .aif, .aiff, .flac)
3. Select and capture the essence of your soundscape by manually starting
     and stopping the record button.  
     Be mindful to turn it off to avoid unnecessary silence!
4. Click START and enjoy.

SAVING THE RESULTS:
As your soundscapes evolve in real-time, you might stumble upon a creation worth keeping. To save the results:
• Choose the name and file location of your future soundscape.
• Capture the part you desire by clicking once to start and twice to finish.
