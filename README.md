## What Is It?  
Imagine an app that creates an entire soundscape around your favorite jingle, sound, or piece of music.  
The **Ambient Soundscape Generator** quietly works behind the scenes to bring you real-time ambient soundscapes, based on the audio file you provide it with.

---

## How It Works  

1. **Turn the sound on** by clicking the speaker button in the top-right corner of the app.  
2. **Drag and drop** your audio file.  
   - Supported formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aif`, `.aiff`, `.flac`.  
3. **Select and capture** the essence of your soundscape by:  
   - Manually starting and stopping the record button.  
   - Be mindful to turn it off to avoid unnecessary silence!  
   - *Tip:* Capture ~3 seconds of sound as the essence of your soundscape, but feel free to experiment.  
4. **Click START and enjoy.**

## Saving the Results  

As your soundscapes evolve in real-time, you might stumble upon a creation worth keeping.  
To save the results:  

- Choose the **name and file location** for your soundscape.  
- Capture the part you desire by clicking **once to start** and **twice to finish**.
